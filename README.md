When India got independence from British in 1947 the literacy rate was 12.2% and as per the recent census 2011 it is 74.0%. Although it looks an accomplishment, still many people are there without access to education. It would be interesting to know the current status of the Indian education system.

This dataset contains district and state wise Indian primary and secondary school education data for 2015-16
